            "African violets rebloom easily in the home. If located properly and watered regularly, little need be done besides occasional fertilization. Use either special African violet fertilizers or a houseplant fertilizer high in phosphorus. Do not use water softened by a system using salt in the process. African violets seldom need pots larger than 4 inches in diameter."

            "Mums are a sun loving plant and prefer an exposure with at least 6 hours of sun per day. Choose a spot with well-drained soil for your mum. When purchasing your mum for planting, plant it as early as possible and water well for the best chance of survival. Fertilizing in the fall is not necessary for your mum. When blooms have expired do not cut the plant back."

            "Fertilize Houseplants Periodically",
            "Most houseplant fertilizers come in either water-soluble or granular form. If you're using a water-soluble fertilizer, you can mix it with water and pour it over the soil around your plants, or dissolve it in a watering can before watering your plants. Granular fertilizers can be mixed in with the soil around your plants, but take care not to get any on the leaves as this could burn them."

            "Pests are those species that attack some resource we human beings want to protect, and do it successfully enough to become either economically important or just a major annoyance. They are only a tiny fraction of the insect species around us. Even many of the species we would recognize as important pests only occasionally do significant damage to us or our resources."

            "How frequently cactus needs water depends on several factors, like time of year, temperature, light exposure, and much more. Don't set a schedule. Sticking to a regular calendar is a common cause of overwatering. Instead, you should get into the habit of checking the soil to determine the right time."
